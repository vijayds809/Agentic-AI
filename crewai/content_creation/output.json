"{\"raw\":\"{\\n  \\\"article\\\": \\\"# Inflationary Dynamics in 2024 and the Evolving Outlook for the Stock Market into 2025\\\\n\\\\n## Executive Summary:\\\\n\\\\nThe year 2024 presented a complex economic landscape. While initially marked by concerns over persistent inflation, the U.S. economy demonstrated notable resilience, supported by strong corporate earnings and robust consumer activity, *despite* a period of elevated interest rates. This positive momentum in the broader market in 2024 sets the stage for the evolving outlook into 2025. Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's October 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations offers nuanced insights into consumer sentiment regarding future inflation, labor market conditions, and their potential implications for investor confidence.\\\\n\\\\n## Inflation Trends:\\\\n\\\\nWhile 2024 saw inflation moderate from its peaks, bringing some relief, the path ahead remains dynamic. The October 2025 Survey of Consumer Expectations reveals that median inflation expectations decreased by 0.2 percentage point to 3.2% at the one-year-ahead horizon, suggesting some alleviation of short-term inflationary pressures. However, medium- and longer-term expectations (three-year and five-year ahead) remained unchanged at 3.0%, indicating a persistent underlying level of inflation anticipated by consumers.\\\\n\\\\nDisagreement across respondents regarding inflation expectations increased at all horizons. Median inflation uncertainty remained unchanged at the one-year-ahead horizon but declined at the three- and five-year-ahead horizons.\\\\n\\\\nSpecific consumer price expectations show a mixed picture for the year ahead from October 2025: \\\\n*   Median home price growth expectations remained stable at 3.0%.\\\\n*   Year-ahead gas price expectations declined by 0.7 percentage point to 3.5%, and food price expectations decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 5.7%.\\\\n*   Conversely, expectations for the cost of college education increased by 1.2 percentage points to 8.2%, medical care by 0.1 percentage point to 9.4% (the highest since February 2023), and rent by 0.2 percentage point to 7.2%.\\\\n\\\\n## Labor Market Expectations (October 2025):\\\\n\\\\nConsumer expectations regarding the labor market are mixed:\\\\n*   Mean unemployment expectations—the probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from October 2025—increased by 1.4 percentage points to 42.5%, marking the third consecutive increase.\\\\n*   However, the mean perceived probability of losing one's job in the next 12 months retreated by 0.9 percentage point to 14.0%.\\\\n*   The mean perceived probability of finding a job if one's current job was lost fell by 0.6 percentage point to 46.8%, indicating some weakening in job-finding confidence, particularly among younger and more educated demographics.\\\\n\\\\n## Impact on the Stock Market:\\\\n\\\\nBuilding on the resilience observed in 2024, which saw positive gains in US equities despite tighter monetary conditions, the outlook for the stock market is now heavily influenced by evolving consumer expectations and economic indicators.\\\\n\\\\nKey observations for 2024 and forward-looking sentiment:\\\\n*   The U.S. economy's ability to withstand elevated interest rates without significant downturn was a notable characteristic of 2024, upending traditional narratives that often predict severe economic contraction during tightening cycles.\\\\n*   Despite some signs of labor market softening in consumer expectations for 2025, the overall resilience in consumption observed in 2024 provided a strong foundation.\\\\n*   However, consumer confidence in the equity market has shown signs of tempering. The mean perceived probability that U.S. stock prices will be higher 12 months from October 2025 decreased by 0.9 percentage point to 38.9%, suggesting a more cautious investor sentiment moving into the future.\\\\n\\\\n## Key Takeaways:\\\\n\\\\n*   The U.S. economy demonstrated resilience in 2024, navigating inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates with robust earnings and sustained consumer activity.\\\\n*   Consumer expectations for inflation in 2025 present a nuanced picture: short-term relief is expected, but longer-term concerns persist, especially for critical services like education, healthcare, and housing.\\\\n*   Labor market expectations for 2025 are mixed, with concerns about overall unemployment rising, yet a slight improvement in job loss probabilities. This complex picture will continue to shape economic stability.\\\\n*   Investor sentiment regarding future stock market performance, as measured by consumer expectations in October 2025, has become more guarded.\\\\n\\\\n## Recommendations:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Monitor Inflationary Signals:** Investors should closely track actual inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy responses, considering the divergence in consumer price expectations for different sectors.\\\\n*   **Evaluate Economic Resilience:** Given the economy's demonstrated resilience in 2024, focus on companies with strong fundamentals, adaptable business models, and a proven ability to perform in varying economic conditions.\\\\n*   **Diversified Portfolio:** Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to mitigate risks associated with evolving inflation and labor market dynamics.\\\\n*   **Stay Informed on Consumer Sentiment:** Consumer expectations play a significant role in economic outcomes.

Unemployment rate and job finding expectations worsened, while job loss expectations slightly improved. Spending and household income growth expectations remained largely unchanged. Perceptions and expectations about credit availability improved, but respondents were somewhat less optimistic about their future household financial situation. The survey was fielded from October 1 through October 31, 2025.\\nThe main findings from the October 2025 Survey are:\\nInflation\\nMedian inflation expectations decreased by 0.2 percentage point to 3.2% at the one-year-ahead horizon in October. They were unchanged at the three-year- (3.0%) and five-year-ahead (3.0%) horizons. The survey’s measure of disagreement across respondents (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of inflation expectations) increased at all horizons.\\nMedian inflation uncertainty—or the uncertainty expressed regarding future inflation outcomes—remained unchanged at the one-year-ahead horizon and declined at the three- and five-year-ahead horizons.\\nMedian home price growth expectations remained unchanged at 3.0% for the fifth consecutive month. This series has been moving in a narrow range between 3.0% and 3.3% since August 2023.\\nMedian year-ahead commodity price change expectations declined by 0.7 percentage point for gas to 3.5% and by 0.1 percentage point for food to 5.7%. The year-ahead price change expectations increased by 1.2 percentage points for the cost of college education to 8.2%, by 0.1 percentage point for the cost of medical care to 9.4% (the highest reading since February 2023), and by 0.2 percentage point for rent to 7.2%.\\nLabor Market\\nMedian one-year-ahead earnings growth expectations increased by 0.2 percentage point to 2.6% in October, remaining below its 12-month trailing average of 2.7%. The series has been moving within the range between 2.4% and 3.0% since May 2021.\\nMean unemployment expectations—or the mean probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now—increased by 1.4 percentage points to 42.5%. This is the third consecutive increase in the series.\\nThe mean perceived probability of losing one’s job in the next 12 months retreated by 0.9 percentage point to 14.0%. The reading is just below the series’ 12-month trailing average of 14.2%. The mean probability of leaving one’s job voluntarily, or the expected quit rate, in the next 12 months decreased by 1.9 percentage points to 18.8%, falling just below its 12-month trailing average of 19.0%.\\nThe mean perceived probability of finding a job if one’s current job was lost fell by 0.6 percentage point to 46.8%, remaining well below its 12-month trailing average of 50.6%. The decline was driven by respondents below age 60 and those with at least some college education.\\nHousehold Finance\\nThe median expected growth in household income declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.8% in October, after remaining unchanged for three consecutive months at 2.9%.\\nMedian one-year-ahead household spending growth expectations increased by 0.1 percentage point to 4.8%. The series has been moving in a range between 4.7% and 5.2% since February 2025.\\nPerceptions of credit access compared to a year ago improved with a smaller share of households reporting it is harder to get credit (the lowest since February 2022) and a larger share of households reporting it is easier to get credit (the highest since October 2024). Expectations for future credit availability also improved, with a smaller share of respondents expecting it will be harder to obtain credit and a larger share of respondents expecting it will be easier to obtain credit in the year ahead.\\nThe average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months increased by 0.5 percentage point to 13.1%, remaining below its 12-month trailing average of 13.3%.\\nThe median expectation regarding a year-ahead change in taxes at current income level decreased by 0.4 percentage point to 3.2%.\\nMedian year-ahead expected growth in government debt declined by 0.3 percentage point to 7.2%.\\nThe mean perceived probability that the average interest rate on saving accounts will be higher in 12 months remained unchanged at 24.9%.\\nPerceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago worsened with a larger share of households reporting a worse financial situation. Year-ahead expectations about households’ financial situations also deteriorated. A larger share of households are expecting a worse financial situation, and a smaller share of households are expecting a better financial situation in one year from now.\\nThe mean perceived probability that U.S. stock prices will be higher 12 months from now decreased by 0.9 percentage point to 38.9%.\\nAbout the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)\\nThe SCE contains information about how consumers expect overall inflation and prices for food, gas, housing, and education to behave. It also provides insight into Americans’ views about job prospects and earnings growth and their expectations about future spending and access to credit. The SCE also provides measures of uncertainty regarding consumers’ outlooks. Expectations are also available by age, geography, income, education, and numeracy.\\nThe SCE is a nationally representative, internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 household heads. Respondents participate in the panel for up to 12 months, with a roughly equal number rotating in and out of the panel each month. Unlike comparable surveys based on repeated cross-sections with a different set of respondents in each wave, this panel allows us to observe the changes in expectations and behavior of the same individuals over time. For further information on the SCE, please refer to an overview of the survey methodology here , the FAQs , the interactive chart guide , and the survey questionnaire .\\nContact\\nMariah   Measey  \\n(347) 978-3071\\nMariah.Measey@ny.frb.org\",\"pydantic\":null,\"json_dict\":null,\"agent\":\"Lead Market Analyst\\n\",\"output_format\":\"raw\"},{\"description\":\"analyze market data and trends related to the Inflation in the US and the impact on the stock market in 2024 with a facous on latest news and patterns that can  be helpful in content creation \\n\",\"name\":\"analyze market data and trends related to the Inflation in the US and the impact on the stock market in 2024 with a facous on latest news and patterns that can  be helpful in content creation \\n\",\"expected_output\":\"a comprehensive report that highlights key developments  and actionable insights.\\n\",\"summary\":\"analyze market data and trends related to the Inflation in...\",\"raw\":\"**Comprehensive Report: Inflation Trends and Impact on the Stock Market in 2024**\\n\\n**Executive Summary:**\\n\\nThe year 2024 was marked by a significant decline in inflation rates, which had a positive impact on the stock market.
